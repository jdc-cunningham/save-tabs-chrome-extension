### These are various chrome extensions that I made(obviously)

#### Save Tabs
The point of this is to save all tabs under some topic as after I build stuff I usually have hundred(s) of tabs open. And also in a way it's like "why am I building this?" why do I care? Just kill the window/clean slate. But it's also nice to see what webpages you referenced/used in the past in case you don't have that purple link that the browser shows to indicate what sites you've looked at before.
